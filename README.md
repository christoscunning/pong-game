# pong-game

Simple arcade style pong game I made using Java and Processing 3.
Also for practice with collisions

Project to practice collisions for Asteroids Game Project as well as 
to compare Processing and ACM as graphics libraries.

Verdict: Both good, I think ACM preforms better/easier to optimize, however to deep into 
Asteroids Game with Processing to be worth switching now. Next project I do using graphics 
I think I'll try ACM.
